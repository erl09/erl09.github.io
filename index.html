    <h1> Ethan Lance  </h1>
    <p> Hey! I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin in the Turing Scholars Program (Computer Science
        Honors). I am looking to add majors in some combination of mathematics, physics, and philosophy. 
        For the time being, this place
        will be very barebones, since I don't have a lot of things to put on here except miscellaneous math notes and
        problem writeups, and I also have no experience developing sites (but also not much time to learn at the moment;
        as I fiddle around with this site throughout my time creating it, maybe I'll learn some stuff).
    </p>
    <p>
        My main interests lie in pure math research, specifically in solving open problems surrounding the Langlands
        program, and I want to pursue a PhD at a top school after undergrad. However, I'm more generally interested in a
        very wide array of fields: theoretical CS, computer architecture, physics, philosophy, biology, ML,
        history and really anything that deepens my understanding of the world around me! Recently, I have also been
        exploring efficient, clean, and intuitive LaTeX compilation on various systems such as WSL2 (Ubuntu), and Arch Linux.
        I also love solving difficult and interesting problems in general, and have been an avid chess player
        since the age of 4.
    </p>
