    <h1> Ethan Lance  </h1>
    <p> Hey! I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin in the Turing Scholars Program (Computer Science
        Honors). I am looking to add majors in some combination of mathematics, physics, and philosophy. 
        For the time being, this place
        will be very barebones, since I don't have a lot of things to put on here except miscellaneous math notes and
        problem writeups, and I also have no experience developing sites (not much time to learn this currently,
        but will slowly pick it up I guess; also no clue about good practices for website creation).
    </p>
    <p>
        My main interests lie in pure math research, specifically in solving open problems surrounding the Langlands
        program, and I want to pursue a PhD at a top school after undergrad. However, I'm more generally interested in a
        very wide array of fields: theoretical CS, computer architecture, ML, physics, philosophy and its history, biology, 
        mathematics, and anything that deepens my understanding of the world.
        I also love solving difficult and interesting problems in general, and have been an avid chess player
        since the age of 4.
    </p>

    <h2> Math/Physics Related Things </h2>
    <h3> Putnam Exam Writeups </h3>
    <p> 
        Most (?) of my Putnam writeups from my time practicing for it. Might be missing a few that I never
        bothered to properly write up. Also doesn't include problem statements (only year/number), because that
        would take way too long when I can search up the problem in 10 seconds at most. Also split into a few
        different PDFs, since I didn't really want to have just one massive .tex file.
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of these probably aren't the "best" solutions, they're just most intuitive to me, and this is mostly
        archiving I guess.

    <h3> Undergrad Math Notes </h3>
    <p>
        A somewhat telegraphic and terse set of notes on various undergraduate
        math courses. I think they're pretty useful for reference, since they contain most major definitions, theorems, 
        and proof sketches. Not too useful for that much else.
